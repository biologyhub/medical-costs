# Why is drug design so expensive?

## Drug modalities<sup>4</sup>
- small molecules
- antibodies
- antibody drug conjugates and cells
  - either alone or in combination.

## Steps in drug design

### Part I: Research
1. Target identification
2. Target validation
3. Hit discovery
  - Assay development and screening
  - High throughput screening

### Part II: Discovery
1. Hit to lead
2. Lead optimization
  - selectively hit the target
  - can be safely absorbed by the body
  - reach the appropriate point in the body to find the target
  - remain in the system long enough to have an effect
  - can be manufactured to produce a stable preparation convenient to use
  - well-tolerated with few side effects

### Part III: Preclinical studies
1. _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ assays
