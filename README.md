# Why is healthcare so expensive?

Almost every aspect of healthcare in the United States is expensive:
  1. medical care (doctors, hospitals, treatments)
  2. medical devices
  3. pharmaceuticals
  4. medical school
  5. research and development

The first three can be categorized as **healthcare**, the actual delivery of treatments to patients. The fourth, medical school, forms the basis of the **medical education**, and the fifth, research and development, is primarily the domain of **biotechnology**. Thus we may divide American medicine into three categories:
  - Medical Education
  - Healthcare
  - Biotechnology
