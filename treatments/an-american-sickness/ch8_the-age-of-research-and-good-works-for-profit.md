# Chapter 8. The age of research and good works for profit: the perversion of a noble enterprise

- Foundations no longer see themselves as funder of research for knowledge propelled by donor dollars, but as investors in new treatments

## A new model: the changing vision of medical charity
- Foundations used to see pharma as adversaries
- Pharma companies wooed foundations by giving corporate money to host events
  - Pharma companies can then use these events as opportunities to promote expensive treatments and devices

## The invention of venture philanthropy
- Venture philanthropy began when Cystic Fibrosis Foundation earned $3.3bn after investing in Vertex Pharmaceuticals that produced Kalydeco, the first blockbuster drug against CF
- Venture philanthropy encourages high prices, because the foundation receives a percentage of profits
  - The foundations that were supposed to **fight for lower prices** are now incentivised to **support higher prices**!
- **Pharma companies often get approval via anecdotal evidence from patients**
  - The argument is a plea to emotion: "how could you be cruel not to approve this medication that makes me feel better?" (even if statistically the drug does not)

## A bible with ads
- Physicians' Desk Reference was a bible of information
- Now, it is infused with drug marketing and promotion

## In the service of medicine &mdash; and money
- American Board of Internal Medicine
  - able to charge internists for re-certification courses
  - counted money as income before the tests were even taken
  - esssentially a Ponzi scheme

## Entering the Gilded age
- In 2011 AMA moved into Ludwig Mies van der Rohe tower in Chicago, IL
- Milton Friedman called AMA the strongest trade union in the U.S.
  - restricts number of medical schools and training slots
- AMA owns copyright on CPT codes
- AMA is third largest spender on lobbying in the US
- Engineered the "doc fix" in Medicare to fight the sustainable growth rate

## Turf battles and trade wars: medical societies form super PACs
- Collectively, the medical industry is the country's biggest lobbying force
- Medical societies act in the interest of the doctors and the industry, NOT THE PATIENT.
- A doctor in Illinois can be in six places at once

## Who writes the guidelines?
- Again, medical societies are not working to determine what's best for the patient, but what reimburses the most.
  - This is apparent when they write recommendations on the appropriate use of certain surgeries (Mohs surgery as an example).
- The specialists who make money from procedures create the guidelines for when and how they should be performed.
  - This is an obvious conflict of interest.
- Non-beneficial "recommendations" by trade groups
  - PSA screening
  - Annual mammograms
