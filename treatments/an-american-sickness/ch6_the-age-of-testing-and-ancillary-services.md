# Chapter 6. The Age of Testing and Ancillary Services

- Testing, medical equipment, and ancillary services have become akin to booze in the restuarant industry
  - high-profit-margin items that can be billed for nearly any amount

## An experiment in billing
- MRIs ordered for no appropriate medical reason
- Ordering more MRIs makes more money for the hospital, however
- USA MRI scan cost: $3470
- Japan MRI scan cost: $160 for the most advanced machine

## Making money with bad medicine: test first, examine later
- In ERs today, PAs and nurses are allowed to order tests before a doctor knows a patient exists
- ProMed can automatically order tests based on the complaint, even if the tests are inappropriate
- If billed as outpatient, insurance comapnies cannot bundle the price into an all-inclusive rate for a hospital inpatient stay (aka more money for the hospital)

## A snip and $1000: how pathology evolved into big business
- Preparing and examining biopsy slides only costs $40 to $100 dollars, but major hospitals charge $500 to $1000 for the service.
- Slides can degrade over travel
- Surgeons don't trust contractors in national labs, so specimens are re-examined in house anyways: two bills for the same analysis

## Taken for a ride: private equity ambulance care
- Hospitals need to guarantee arrivals: ambulances bring the paying customers!
- Ambulance companies progressively unbundled their bills
  - In Los Angeles, which sets charges for all ambulance providers:
    - base rate for a basic ambulance ride in 2014 was $1,033.50
    - base rate for advanced life support team ambulance ride: $1,445
    - $19 per mile
    - $51.50 for every fifteen minutes of waiting
    - extras
      - $84.75 if itâ€™s after 7 p.m.
      - $65.75 for the use of an oxygen tank
      - $27.25 for each ice pack and bandage, and the oxygen mask
- Ambulance rides generate more than $200 million for NYC each year

## No pain, big gains: the business of physical therapy
- Physical therapy: $750 per session, twice a week for a month: ~$6000 dollars
- 1990s, PT session cost around $100
- Four PT centers in town of 3,102 people
- American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) lobbied for moratoriums (delays) on the implementation of PT session cost caps.
- 2014, PT industry worth $26.6 billion

## Preying on the elderly for profit
- People on Medicare tend to get more colonscopies than guidelines recommend. **This procedure kills people, and is humiliating for old people.**
- Home evaluation companies (e.g. CenseoHealth) work with insurance comapnies to push up Medicare plan prices by adjusting risk scores upward (i.e. people pay more for their plan).
- Well-insured patients often suffer from too much treatment
