# Chapter 12. The high price of patient complacency

Prescriptions for taking back our healthcare.

## General tools that underpin low costs of healthcare elsewhere

### Fee schedules and national price negotiations
- Larger buyer = larger negotiating power
- Administrative costs
  - In the United States, doctors spend one-sixth of their time on administration
  - Medical practices hire extra staff to wrangle with insurers
- National fee schedule does not preclude private insurance

### Single-payer
- Used in
  - Canada
  - Australia
  - Taiwan
- Socialized healthcare, where hospitals, insurance, and major healthcare infrastructure are state-owned
  - Denmark
  - Great Britain

### Market-based tools of transparency and competition
- Singapore
  - Most hospitals are public (state-owned)
  - Private hospitals exist, but they need to charge accordingly because the state's offerings are quite good
  - Government limits purchases of expensive machines that end up overused.
