# Chapter 3. The Age of Physicians

- Associations that have lowered their moral/ethical commitments in their official pledges
  - American College of Surgeons
  - American Medical Association

## What is a doctor's work worth?
- medical school is expensive and long
  - $120k state school
  - $220k private university
  - mean debt of $170k
- residency (apprenticeship before becoming an independent doctor) ranges from 3 to 7 years
- intense patient care specialties
  - general surgery
  - internal medicine
  - OB-GYN
  - cardiology
- debt for specialty training (as a **fellow**) generally around $21k
- however, doctors are paid well for their work
- doctors want in on the profits being made in the hospital

## The price of a cure: a brief history of doctors' finances
- Medicare Part B paid 98% to physicians, and so billing high fees resulted in high physician income, and likewise, high medical bills (high insurance premiums)
- Medicare constructed RBRVS (resource-based relative value scale) in order to determine a fair price for each procedure that may be performed by a doctor)
- RBRVS was measured in RVUs (relative value units)
  - RVUs varied based on 
    - work/time spent on intervention
    - overhead incurred in providing the service
    - cost of training
    - malpractice expenses involved
- RBRVS was eventually exploited

## Doctors get the key to the vault
- Medicare gave American Medical Association governance over RBRVS
  - an ill-advised decision
- Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC)
  - Grants equal representation to each specialty; larger (more general) specialties lose out
- RUC is broken

## Strategy 1: Doctor-Entrepreneur-Owner
- Open up special outpatient centers like _surgicenters_.
- Private-equity firms often play a role
  - E.g. Nueterra Capital
- Special outpatient centers are not negotiated by the insurer and thus are not subject to previously agreed contract prices.

## Strategy 2: The hidden doctors and their mysterious bills
- Physicians you never see and names you probably don't know: "no patient contact" specialists
  - Pathologists
  - Anesthesiologists
  - Radiologists
- Essentially, any specialist that could move their services outside the hospital did, and charged accordingly (aka high).
- They also do not contract with insurance to avoid price limits.

## Strategy 3: The pacts doctors make
- Hospitals without specialists had to make contracts with specialists to satisfy EMTALA
  - Specialists would cover the emergency room, and in turn get to charge whatever amount they wanted to patients with good insurance

## Strategy 4: One doctor for the price of two
- Use of physician extenders allows for a physician to bill for simultaneous treatments.
- These physician assistants deliver worse care, while allowing the doctor to bill more.

## Strategy 5: Selling stuff &endash; buy and bill
- Physicians engaged in kickback schemes involving the purchase and billing of drugs that may not even be indicated.
- Oncologists buying expense chemotherapy drugs boosted profits between 1995 to 2004, doubling their median compensation to $350,000.

## Strategy 6: Upgrades
- Upgrades such as Toric lenses and laser assisted surgeries (that might not have benefits for the patient).

## Strategy 7: Adopt a surgical procedure
- Nephrologists have begun offering fistula surgeries that were previously solely in the domain of vascular surgeons with far more training.
- However, surgeries are far more profitable than typical nephrologist treatments, such as dialysis.
