# Chapter 9. The Age of Conglomerates

- Consolidated alliances mean inordinate sway to demand high rates from
  - Corporations
  - Insurers
  - HMOs
- Hospital mergers are associated with
  - more cardiac procedures
  - increase in patient deaths
- Hospitals without competition can get away with rendering only profitable services

## Pioneers: Sutter or bust
- Since 2000, more than 70 California hospitals had to close
- Mothers have great loyalty to the hospital where they gave birth
- By 2014, Sutter Health assembled
  - 24 hospitals
  - 34 outpatient surgicenters
  - 9 cancer centers
  - 1000s of affiliated doctor practices
- Sutter Health holds a monopoly in hospital care in many areas of California.

## The doctor's Faustian bargain
- Sutter Health's dominance over insurance negotiations can lead to independent doctors to be excluded from patient insurance networks.
  - (?) wouldn't it be better for the insurance company to work with independent doctors?

## The EMR as a business weapon
- Sutter Health's EMR set as default many Sutter services
- Competitors are not able to input results into the Sutter EMR

## What happens to small hospitals after consolidation
- Insurance companies may not want to sign with Sutter, but doing so would leave many patients uninsured in regions where only Sutter Health was available
- Critical access program was being abused since it eliminated the typical cost-saving barriers imposed by Medicare
  - This also increases the number of air ambulances needed

## A part-time emergency room
- ER care has been commercialized, governed not by patient needs but by finances
- The opening of freestanding ERs: waste time, and bill double

## A Catholic hospital conglomerate makes off with a bequest
- Trinity Health keep the $10 million donation to Cadillac Hospital, even after it sold the hospital

## Consoldiation: rebranding doctors' offices
- Hospital systems have been acquiring:
  - Other hospitals
  - X-ray centers
  - Doctor's offices
- Acquiring doctors' offices enables the hospital to bill with "facility fees"
- **Insurers need hospitals in their networks.**
