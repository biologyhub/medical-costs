# Chapter 4. The Age of Pharmaceuticals

## The modest history of making medicines
- More than one patent per medicine
- Hatch-Waxman
  - was intended to incentivize creating more generic medications
  - offered patent extensions for certain tasks
  - led the pharma industry to file lawsuits each time a new generic appears, ultimately driving costs upward (instead of downward as intended)
  - without limits on price increases, pharamceutical industry increased prices of still-patented drugs to "make up" lost revenue on drugs with patents that had expired

## New policies transform an industry
- HIV drove creation of FDA surrogate measures
  - Essentially relaxed approval requirements
  - Now treatments don't need to solve the problem, only reduce signs
- 1990: FDA also approved "help seeking ads", aka direct-to-consumer ads
  - Merck, Vioxx painkiller scandal
- R&D costs: from 40 to 125 million dollars

## Non-24: it pays to advertise
- FDA panels don't consider the cost of the products they review
- Strategy: find an orphan condition that is similar to a general population condition, and then use the expedited approval process
- **Practice of comparing new drugs with placebos rather than other currently available treatments as a criterion for licensing has also led to both a plethora of expensive me-too drugs and a dearth of trials and published efficacy studies.**

## Patent plays
1. File a lawsuit.
  - Under Hatch-Waxman, an objection from the brand name company immediately sets off a 30-month halt in the FDA approval process.
  - Lawsuits can often be settled with **pay-for-delay** agreements, where the brand name company pays an amount to a generics manufacturer in order to delay the arrival of the generic.
  - Example: Sanofi sued Eli Lilly for producing a biosimilar
2. Modify the delivery.
  - Technique is known as "product hopping"
  - Example: Warner Chilcott's birth control pills, Loestring 24 Fe to a chewable version called Minastrin 24 Fe.
  - Generics must be identical in dosage and form to the brand-name drug for a pharmacist to substitute; switching delivery delays development of generics.
3. Play to the FDA's weaknesses and blind spots.
  - FDA think's it is helping, and offers up market incentives that ultimately hurt the market.
4. Take it over the counter.
  - Example: Flonase
  - Taking a product over the counter can also eliminate generics because the same product cannot be sold both OTC and as a prescription.
5. Create a combination

## Desperate patients and bribes, or charity?
- Copay coupons
  - Money can still be billed to the insurance company
  - Discounts are tax-deductible
- Patient Access Network is a legal way for kickbacks on Medicare

## The rise of invisible robber barons
- PBM = pharmacy benefit manager
- Insurance companies hire PBMs to negotiate drug purchases with pharmacies
- They are the reason the drugs available through insurance keep changing

## "We regret to inform you that the generic is not available"
- Glaxo seemingly played a role in removing generic antinausea drugs from the market
- GPOs get a percentage of sales as profit, so they like to purchase more expensive drugs
- Shortages of cheaper, afforable essential medicines have become the new normal

## Generic sticker shock 
- Corner a niche market then raise prices
- Even if it is a generic drug, if no one else is producing it, then you have a monopoly

## Myth: at least we get drugs first
- This is only true if there is a good business model (money can be made)
- If there is an existing product that is not as good, then the later product will be lobbied against by the incumbent.
- Allergy treatments make money, so any cheaper and better alternative is not good
