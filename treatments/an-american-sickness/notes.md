# Elisabeth Rosenthal, An American Sickness
How healthcare became big business and how you can take it back.

## New terms
- **medical loss ratio (MLR)**. the percentage of each premium dollar spent on medical care; it measures how efficiently the premiums pay for their intended use: medical care.
  - Medicare's MLR = 0.98
  - Texas Blues' MLR = 0.644
- **upcoding**.
- **facility fee**. a fee for using space at an outpatient service.

## Introduction &mdash; Complaint: Unaffordable Healthcare
- U.S. healthcare costs 17.7% of GDP, twice that (GDP) of other developed nations.
  - About 3.8 trillion dollars
- **history and physical (H&P)**. the method used by doctors to understand complex problems (e.g. a patient's health)
  - parts of the H&P
    - chief complaint
    - history of the present illness and review of systems
    - diagnosis and treatment
- financial incentives encourage the most aggressive and expensive treatments for any ailment

## Economic rules of the dysfunctional medical market
1. More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.
2. A lifetime of treatment is preferable to a cure.
3. Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.
4. As technologies age, prices can rise rather than fall.
5. There is no free choice. Patients are stuck. And they’re stuck buying American.
6. More competitors vying for business doesn’t mean better prices; it can drive prices up, not down.
7. Economies of scale don’t translate to lower prices. With their market power, big providers can simply demand more.
8. There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. And the uninsured pay the highest prices of all.
9. There are no standards for billing. There’s money to be made in billing for anything and everything.
10. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.

## Part 1: History of the present illness and review of systems

### (1) The Age of Insurance

#### Beginnings of insurance
- Blue Cross Association in Texas
- Aimed to compensate for income lost while workers were ill

#### Modern Day Insurance
- Archetype developed at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas in the **1920s**
- Hospitals carried many unpaid bills
- Original plan
  - $6 a year premium
  - deductible of $35, a one-week stay at the hospital
  - afterwards, insurance paid the entire bill for 21 days ($105)
  - intended **only for catastrophic care**, to protect against major health disasters
  - never intended to make healthcare cheap: our expectations for insurance have grown
- These were the original **Blue Cross Plans**, and were not-for-profit
  - Furthermore, after 21 days at the hospital, you were likely either cured or dead
- Advances in technology meant that more patients could be saved
  - This also meant that $5 a day and 21 day limits were not enough
- World War II helped cement employer-based health care
  - Companies faced labor shortages, attracted workers by offering health insurance
  - To encourage this, government ruled that money paid for employee health benefits would not be taxed
- Blue Cross/Blue Shield was not-for-profit, making health insurance very popular
- Furthermore, employees expected employers to pay for it due to employer-provided health insurance 
- This provided a business opportunity for for-profit health insurance companies such as Aetna and Cigna
  - They took on the healthiest patients, leaving BCBS with the sickest
  - BCBS eventually allowed its member plans to become for-profit, so that it could access the stock market to raise capital
- Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a perverse incentive to increase prices by forcing MLR of 0.85
  - Increase the base, and profits can still increase despite a smaller percentage payout
- **Health insurance companies don't necessarily do better by negotiating better rates.**
  - Instead of bargaining for decent prices, insurers refine their messaging to cultivate loyalty, whether or not it is deserved.
  - e.g. insurance "saved" you 96%! (reality: that's in your premiums or deductible!)

### (2) The Age of Hospitals
- Hospitals that are non-profits must spend excess income
  - Excess income is spent on executive compensation and lobbies/gardens
- Hospitals are a market failure
  - Consultants all wanting to collect a piece of the pie

#### Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
- Created in the 1990s due to ballooning healthcare costs

#### Enter the consultants
- Deloitte & Touche
  - Hired Tommy Thompson
- Deloitte introduced the idea of strategic billing, aka charging high prices for the products that insurance covers
  - This means that the billed price of an item can be completely decoupled from its actual cost

#### Strategic billing 101
- Many health systems use some form of relative value unit in determining salary or bonuses
- This encourages doctors to upcode treatments to make it as though more care had been given
- This means that hospitals make more money (by charging it to the insurance, and indirectly, the customer)
- Furthermore, the more nebulous the bill, the better
  - e.g. facility fees for outpatient care

#### Closing departments: make money or die
- Departments that traditionally lost money
  - Emergency room
  - Labor and delivery
  - Dialysis centers
  - Drug treatment programs
  - Outpatient clinics for Medicaid
- Big winners
  - Orthopedics
  - Cardiac care
  - Stroke center (expensive scans)
  - Cancer care (drug infusions)

#### The business of medical training: hospitals and cheap labor
- Residents serve as cheap labor
- Doctors have had their hours cut

#### The emergence of hospital-hotels
- Bonuses for CEOs are not based on medical outcomes but on factors such as
  - finance
  - quality
  - profit
  - admissions growth
  - increase in net funds

#### The most profitable nonprofits: the evolution of hospital charity
- Goal is to minimize **charity care and community benefit** while still qualifying for it
- Form 990 Schedule H
  - hospitals need to disclose how much money-losing care they dispense

#### Observation status: a new financial purgatory in the hospital
- Observation status means higher copays
- Medicare doesn't have billable limits for outpatient costs
- Furthermore, penalties don't exist for outpatient outcomes
