# Systemic issues in healthcare pricing

## The wrong incentives

- Physicians are incentivized to bill more, because they get paid more for doing so.
- The cheaper the bill, the lower the physician's income.
- Medicine has turned into a business that simply looks to drive profit. The incentives are wrong.
