# Chapter 7. The Age of Contractors

Billing, Coding, Collections, and New Medical Businesses

## A brief history of medical coding
- CPT: current procedural terminology
- history of coding was simply to track causes of death
- Coding for more lucrative procedures requires knowledge of the details to qualify
- Modifier 59 allowed to simultaneous coding for same/equivalent procedures
- ICD-10 was released in 1992; implemented in the US in 2015, because ICD-9 was entrenched in the medical billing world

## The verifiers and certifiers
- Precertification existed originally to review a small number of really expensive producedures to determine whether or not they were truly needed
- Now, precertification exists as a roadblock where companies get paid based on the number of procedures they reject (i.e. the amount of money they "help" "save")

## Patient advocates: on your side?
- Patient advocates have a bad business model: once the information is out, their service is no longer needed.
