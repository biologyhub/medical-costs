# Chapter 11. The Age of the Affordable Care Act

- Well-intentioned provisions in the ACA have been abused
  - That's what optimization does
- What did the ACA do?
  - barred insurers from denying insurance to people with preexisting conditions
    - preexisting conditions had been abused (lowering standards)
  - banned lifetime limits on insurance payouts
  - cap out-of-pocket spending per person as long as patient stays in network
  - define essential health benefits every insurance policy must cover
  - free screening for certain conditions

## Costs take a U-turn: the lesson of Medicare drug coverage
- Medicare Part D added in 2006
- Medicare Part D allowed price hikes on cheap drugs, since they were going to be paid for anyways

## How politicians undermined the ACA
- Health Insurance Cooperatives were offered as a substitute for the public option; politicians undercut the funding for the coops, most of which going bankrupt

## How insurers undermined the ACA
- Strategy 1: Insurers pass cost to patients through "high-deductible" plans
  - High deductibles often lead to healthcare avoidance
- Strategy 2: Narrow network sizes
  - Often leads to second-rate doctors in the network
  - The best have enough leverage to not join
- Doctors can be dropped at will

## How hospitals and doctors undermined the ACA
- "Providers should not leave money on the table"
- Easier to make money overbilling than to follow the rules and gain small benefits
- Abuse of the interpretation of the ACA
  - e.g. Free colonoscopy, but not free if a polyp is removed for examination
