- Even the most liberal fall victim
  - Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken, Elizabeth Warren
    - Received campaign donations
    - Worked to repeal 2.3% excise tax on medical devices that would fund ACA

## The secret history of medical devices and their regulation
- Three classes of medical devices
- Many medical devices don't even have clinical trials

- Stryker Rejuvenate
- Needed to create newer products to upsell

## How to get into a patient's heart? Follow the money
- Annuloplasty ring was never tested, led to heart failure
- Protecting patents often results in agreements between two companies, who then have incentive to increase the product price (which gets charged to the patient)
