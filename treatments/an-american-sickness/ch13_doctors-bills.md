## What you can start doing now

### Choosing your doctor
- Is the practice owned by a hospital or licensed as a surgery center?
  - Yes? You may pay for outrageous facility fees.
  - Can also specifically ask if a "facility fee" will be billed.
- Will you refer me only to other physicians in my insurance network, or explain in advance if you can't?
  - PCPs may have relationships with specialists, but they may also be business deals.
- If I need blood work or radiology testing, can you send me to an in-network lab?
  - Commercialized blood work is much cheaper than in-house.
- Will there be charges for phone advice or filling out forms? Is there an annual practice fee?
- If I'm hospitalized, will you be seeing me in the hospital? What is your coverage on weekends?

#### In your doctor's office
- How much will this test/surgery/exam cost?
  - "I don't know" and "depends on your insurance" are not answers.
  - Get a ballpark range.
- How will this test/surgery/exam change my treatment?
  - If there's no good reason, then you probably don't need it.
- Which blood test are you ordering? What X-ray? Why?
- Are there cheaper alternatives that are equally good, or nearly so?
- Where will this test/surgery/exam be performed: at the hospital, at a surgery center, or in the office? How does the place impact the price?
- Who else will be involved in my treatment? Will I be getting a separate bill from another provider? Can you recommend someone in my insurance network?
