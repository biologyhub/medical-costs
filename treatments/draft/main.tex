\section{An overview of the U.S. healthcare system}

There are nine types of hospitals in the United States:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Short-term acute care hospitals
\item Long-term acute care hospitals
\item Childrenâ€™s hospitals
\item Critical access hospitals
\item Psychiatric hospitals
\item Rehabilitation hospitals
\item VA (Veterans Administration) hospitals
\item Department of Defense hospitals
\item Religious non-medical health care institutions

\end{enumerate}


A {\bf payer} (sometimes spelled {\bf payor}) is the entity responsible for processing patient eligibility, services, claims, enrollment, and payment \cite{defhealth-payers}. In other words, the {\bf payer to a health care provider} is the organization that

\begin{itemize}
\item negotiates or sets rates for provider services
\item collects revenue through premium payments or tax dollars
\item processes provider claims for service, and
\item pays provider claims using collected premium or tax revenues.
\end{itemize}

Payers include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)
\item Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
\item healthcare service contractors
\item state insurance agencies
\item claim handlers
\item and more
\end{itemize}

\section{How prices are set}

The hospital {\bf charge master} (also known as the {\bf chargemaster}, or sometimes {\bf charge description master (CDM)}) is a table that lists each procedure (identified by a {\bf procedure code}) with its {\bf base price}, similar to the MSRP price listed for everyday purchases. Because the charge master price is the MSRP price, patients often pay a lower price, one that is negotiated by the payor (the insurance company).

In a simple diagram, the price paid by the patient is derived as: base price $\rightarrow$ payor-negotiated price $\rightarrow$ deductible (the ``balance bill'').
