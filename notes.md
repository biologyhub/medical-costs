1. One of our biggest difficulties is **choosing the wrong target**. [1]
2. We have all sorts of compounds that make it into human trials and then don’t actually work, because it turns out that our hypothesis about the underlying disease was just wrong. [1]
    - What causes Alzheimer’s?
    - What’s the best way to interrupt septic shock?
    - What’s the underlying cause of Parkinson’s disease?
    - What’s the best target to work on to deal with chronic pain?
    - What’s the actual biochemical cause of major depression?
    - If you wanted to reverse fibrosis in a given tissue, how would you best go about that?
3. **Better models (animal and otherwise) of such diseases and conditions would be great to have**, but you would need to know a lot more about the disease before you can work up a good model to mimic it. [1]
4. **A better warning system for toxicity in human trials**.
5. First off, though, the chances of success for a compound entering Phase I trials have not increased: it’s still slightly under 10%, same as other estimates over the last couple of decades. [2]
6. The reasons for these failures appear to be unchanged: 75 to 80% of Phase III trial failures are due to problems with efficacy and/or safety. [2]
    - And that, to me, is the second most important figure in the pharmaceutical industry, showing just how much we don’t know about what we’re doing.
    - What targets to pick, what else they might do when we affect them, what other things our compounds might do when we try: find a way to understand and predict those things better and everything changes.
7. It’s for sure that some of the hottest research areas right now (such as bifunctional protein degraders) can produce some rather off-the-beaten-track structures. So how do we reconcile these? Can we be making innovative drugs using a bunch of boring reactions? [3]
8. There are just so many more neat little functionalized compounds available now; it’s become an entire business of its own. [4]
