1. One of our biggest difficulties is **choosing the wrong target**. [1]
2. We have all sorts of compounds that make it into human trials and then don’t actually work, because it turns out that our hypothesis about the underlying disease was just wrong. [1]
    - What causes Alzheimer’s?
    - What’s the best way to interrupt septic shock?
    - What’s the underlying cause of Parkinson’s disease?
    - What’s the best target to work on to deal with chronic pain?
    - What’s the actual biochemical cause of major depression?
    - If you wanted to reverse fibrosis in a given tissue, how would you best go about that?
3. **Better models (animal and otherwise) of such diseases and conditions would be great to have**, but you would need to know a lot more about the disease before you can work up a good model to mimic it. [1]
4. **A better warning system for toxicity in human trials**.
5. First off, though, the chances of success for a compound entering Phase I trials have not increased: it’s still slightly under 10%, same as other estimates over the last couple of decades. [2]
6. The reasons for these failures appear to be unchanged: 75 to 80% of Phase III trial failures are due to problems with efficacy and/or safety. [2]
    - And that, to me, is the second most important figure in the pharmaceutical industry, showing just how much we don’t know about what we’re doing.
    - What targets to pick, what else they might do when we affect them, what other things our compounds might do when we try: find a way to understand and predict those things better and everything changes.
7. It’s for sure that some of the hottest research areas right now (such as bifunctional protein degraders) can produce some rather off-the-beaten-track structures. So how do we reconcile these? Can we be making innovative drugs using a bunch of boring reactions? [3]
8. There are just so many more neat little functionalized compounds available now; it’s become an entire business of its own. [3]
9. The simple fact is that we still haven't figured out the workings of biological systems - the human body in this case - to an extent that allows us to rationally and predictably modify, mitigate or cure their ills using small organic molecules. [5]
10. Firstly, it takes a lot of sleuthing and arduous biochemical and genetic experimentation to find out if a particular protein is in fact a major contributor to a disease. [5]
11. But even if the protein's role in causing disease is established, not every protein can then actually bind to a synthetic small molecule and be modulated by it. [5]
12. Reason 1: Drugs work by modulating the function of proteins. It's difficult to find out exactly which proteins are involved in a disease. Even if these proteins are found, it is difficult then to know if their activity can be controlled by a small molecule drug. [5]
13. Reason 2: Since nature has not really optimized its proteins for binding to drugs, it is very difficult to find a hit for a protein even after searching through millions of molecules, either natural or artificial. And even when a hit is discovered, we don't know for sure how to turn it into a drug with favorable properties. [6]
14. Reason 3: It is very difficult to get drugs into cells, partly on the basis of fundamental chemical properties and partly because nature has conspired to create specific proteins whose job is to keep drugs out. What's worse is that we still have little idea exactly what kinds of drugs are kept out by these proteins, so that we have to work on the basis of trial and error to find those that escape their clutches and get in. [7]
